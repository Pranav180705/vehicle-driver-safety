# Vehicle & Driver Safety AI Platform (Simplified Version)

This project demonstrates two safety-related AI modules (Python 3.13 compatible):

1. **Driver Drowsiness Detection** - Uses OpenCV Haar cascades to detect eyes and warn if eyes are closed.
2. **Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR)** - Uses OpenCV + EasyOCR to detect and read license plates.

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
